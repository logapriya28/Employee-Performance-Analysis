    "INX Future Inc, is one of the leading data analytics and automation solutions provider with over 15 years of global business presence. In recent years, the employee performance indexes are not healthy and this has become a growing concern among the top management. The CEO Mr. Brain, decided to initiate a data science project, which analyzes the current employee data and find the core underlying causes of the performance issues. He also expects a clear indicators of non-performing employees, so that any penalization of non-performing employee, if required, may not significantly affect other employee morals.\n",
    "The following insights are expected from this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Department wise performances.\n",
    "   2. Top 3 Important Factors effecting employee performance.\n",
    "   3. A trained model which can predict the employee performance based on factors as inputs.\n",
    "   4. Recommendations to improve the employee performance based on insights from analysis.\n",
    "\n",

    "##  Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal 1: Department wise performances\n",
    "\n",
    "In department wise performance, we have to analyze the data from each department present in the category. There are six departments in the Dataset. The performance analysis by the department as follows,\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Sales: The Performace rating level 3 is more in the sales department. The total work experience does not relate with the the performance rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Human Resources: The majority of the employees lying under the level 3 performance. The older people are performing low in this department. The female employees in HR department are good in their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Development: The largest number of employees are level 3 performers. Employees of all age are performing at the level of 3 only.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Data Science: The highest average of level 3 performance is in data science department. Data science is the only department where less number of level 2 performers. The overall performance is higher compared to all departments. \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Research & Development: Different employees with different age are there in every level of performance. The R&D has the good female employees in their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Finance: The finance department performance is exponentially decreasing when age increases. The male employees are doing good. The experience factor is inversely relating to the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal 2: The Top 3 important features affecting the employee performance\n",
    "\n",
    "  The important feaures affecting the performance are analyzed using visualization and random forest and gradient bossting classifier. The top three important features affecting the performance rating are ordered with their importance level as follows,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Employment Environment Satisfaction\n",
    "2. Employee Salary Hike Percentage\n",
    "3. Years Since the last Promotion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal 3: A Trained model which can predict the employee performance\n",
    "\n",
    "The trained model is created using the machine learning algorithm as follows with the accuracy score,\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Random Forest classifier: 90% accuracy\n",
    "   - Gradient boosted Classifier: 91% accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal 4: Recommendations to improve the employee performance\n",
    "\n",
    "   From the results, we can conclude that the company should provide a good environment to the employees which would increase the performance. \n",
    "   The company should provide a good hike to the employees which will boost them to perform well.\n",
    "   The company should help them to maintain a worklife balance. \n",
    "   On the other hand, shuffling the manager from time to time will also affect performance.\n",
